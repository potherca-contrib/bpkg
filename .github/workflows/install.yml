# The idea here is to run Shellcheck for each file, so violations can be fixed
# incrementally. As soon as a file has been fixed to pass shellcheck, it should
# no longer be allowed to fail.
#
# Once all files have been fixed, the jobs can all be replaced by one single run
# that checks all files at once.
#
# For discussion and further details see: https://github.com/bpkg/bpkg/issues/78
